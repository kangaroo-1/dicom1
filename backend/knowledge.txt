Common Modality Types:
X-ray: A medical imaging technique that uses X-rays to view the inside of the body. 
MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging, uses magnetic fields and radio waves.
CT scan: Computed Tomography, a series of X-ray images taken from different angles.
CR:Digital X-ray using imaging plates.
US (Ultrasound)Imaging using high-frequency sound waves.
XR (X-ray)Standard X-ray imaging.
MG (Mammography)X-ray imaging of the breast.
NM (Nuclear Medicine)Imaging using radioactive tracers.
PT (Positron Emission Tomography)Nuclear imaging technique for metabolic processes.
DX (Digital Radiography)Digital X-ray imaging (similar to CR but direct).
RF (Radio Fluoroscopy)Continuous real-time X-ray imaging.
DS (Digital Subtraction Angiography)Enhanced angiography by removing background structures.
ECG (Electrocardiography)Electrical activity of the heart.
